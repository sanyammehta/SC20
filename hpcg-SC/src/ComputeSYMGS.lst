   25.            Routine to compute one step of symmetric Gauss-Seidel:
   26.          
   27.            Assumption about the structure of matrix A:
   28.            - Each row 'i' of the matrix has nonzero diagonal value whose address is matrixDiagonal[i]
   29.            - Entries in row 'i' are ordered such that:
   30.                 - lower triangular terms are stored before the diagonal element.
   31.                 - upper triangular terms are stored after the diagonal element.
   32.                 - No other assumptions are made about entry ordering.
   33.          
   34.            Symmetric Gauss-Seidel notes:
   35.            - We use the input vector x as the RHS and start with an initial guess for y of all zeros.
   36.            - We perform one forward sweep.  Since y is initially zero we can ignore the upper triangular terms of A.
   37.            - We then perform one back sweep.
   38.                 - For simplicity we include the diagonal contribution in the for-j loop, then correct the sum after
   39.          
   40.            @param[in] A the known system matrix
   41.            @param[in] r the input vector
   42.            @param[inout] x On entry, x should contain relevant values, on exit x contains the result of one symmetric GS sweep with r as the RHS.
   43.          
   44.            @return returns 0 upon success and non-zero otherwise
   45.          
   46.            @warning Early versions of this kernel (Version 1.1 and earlier) had the r and x arguments in reverse order, and out of sync with other kernels.
